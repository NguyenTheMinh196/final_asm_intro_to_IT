                      <div class = "information_block"> <p>Initially, we would like to introduce a map which is specifically focus on our Saigon South RMIT campus called R-Map. The name R-map simply is the combination of our school's name and map. Like its name. The object of this map are newbies and visitors who want to explore our campus as it can help them to familiarize with our school. Several buildings will be displayed in the application. For each building, rooms and theatre, also our cafeteria corner and parking lot are all included. The details of the application will impress people, encourage them to take a trip around our campus. It will be a poster pinned on the campus’s entrance that represent the QR Code for them to download and enjoy.   
                      <br>
                      Since we are green to IT, using codes for application development seems unreasonable. Alternatively, we use Adobe draw so we can create a simple and understandable user interface. Not only user friendliness, it inspires us to design a beautiful map and adding more features to it. Actually, R-map is not only a map but we also added more “cool” elements to the application such as achievement system that updates automatically after you reach a new location. In the future, we may advance it into a 3-D map, represent an extraordinary view of our Saigon South campus.

                      <div class = "information_block"> <p>Tuan, founder of this project, experience anecdotally when he first came to the campus, faced difficulties and direction-lost as he did not know where is it and it also the norm with others newbies. Despite of ask for random person which is sometime uncomfortable, he wonder if our campus has a map that describe every details of our campus. This is not something that happens to only Tuan but also many more newcomers. Moreover, when we gather to decide the project for this assignment (from one of the ideals), we saw that Tuan’s application is most likely doable in comparison with others imaginative ideals and also by its practicability and suitability for this course so we decided to take it as our project. We also want an app that we will be having by our side when exploring the RMIT campus. As we all know and experience, there are many amazing things that we have when we join the course in RMIT but most people aren’t interested in exploring it. It is such a waste that people don’t explore the campus fully which is why we decided to create an app to encourage them to do so. Furthermore, We also see an increasing trend of local organization services, so we planning to take present ourselves with a lovely school’s map.      </p> </div>

                      <div class = "information_block" style = "margin-bottom: 10px"> <p>Our project is decorated with some similarity with currently global well-known application, Google map. These designed used high-tech devices from satellites to draw earth’s map. From that, users get the location by turning on Bluetooth device with the deviation only up to approximately 50 meters. From that, they can guess their location. <br> However, our application focuses on the campus with several relevant RMIT-related aspects. This is an application that will only be only for people visiting RMIT which will be having much more function for it than competitors such as google map. Since we will also go into detail for the RMIT map which help it become much more detail than google map You can turn on your location devices to know (probably) exactly where you are in the campus. Also, it illustrates direction to the room that people want to travel. Next, achievement feature that you can get award when visiting a new room and take it in the souvenir. This feature is, up to a point, the same of PokemonGo. About the availability, we use the software which was designed specifically for IOS, so our current application only available on IOS-based now. Nonetheless, we will try to advance this app on others technology platform such as Window and Android.   </p> </div>

                      <div class = "information_block"> <p>As this is our first semester studying at RMIT, we have no idea where all of the rooms and facilities are located. For a student to come in and suddenly be given instruction to go to rooms such as Mac-lab, Melbourne theatre or room such as 2.4.03 might be hard for them to even know which room. Due to this problem, we have a hard time to get from places to places as there are so many buildings and rooms around our campus. Also, for some people, especially the introverts, it is very difficult for them to ask random strangers for directions. Many of us are desperate to have a map of the school. Because of those reasons, we come up with the project creating an application that is designed to show places in RMIT Saigon South campus. We want to create an app that can deliver general information and guide us who are currently studying in RMIT university. The targets of the applications are newbies and visitors as it can help them navigate the route to go to the destination that they want. However, we will be even aim for it to be useful for every person in RMIT and not just newcomer. Many cool features and activities will be included for the users to interact with the app (such as scanning the nearby constructions to know where you are standing, getting achievements for visiting a place, etc.). With user-friendly interface, as well as those interesting features, it will be suitable for everybody to use, especially for the freshmen who first study at RMIT.  </p> </div>

                          <div class = "information_block" style = "margin-bottom: 10px">
                          <p> The first goal that we want to do when we thought of creating this app is for the newbie to use. When I and my team members get to school for the first time, we didn’t how each building are called and why the room is usually following the code such as 2.4.40. Moreover, there are many rooms even having names attached to it such as Melbourne Theatre. They also not familiarize themselves with RMIT campus which lead to not understanding what use that each room can have which is a huge loss for every single student who miss it. Did you know that you can go to the school gym for free at building 10? It will become a tool for the newcomer to know where to find the room they will be learning in. With this app, no matter how bad your communication might be, you can always find your way to get to class or even find what you are looking for.  </p>

                          <div class = "information_block" style = "margin-bottom: 10px">
                          <p> Not only we will be aiming for having the map and general information about each room in the campus but also be containing specific information about each room. We also want to add feature such as dividing staff and students so that they can update the content at the facility that they are at. For example, a person who are working at the content can change the menu inside the canteen daily so that student can always go into the app to check what is available today. By no means that it will only be limited to the canteen but you can also check to see if that room is booked or not. It is similar to the use of the current app that helps student to see if the room is booked or not by scanning the QR code. However, we want to add that application into our app so that student can search for it much easier comparing to scanning the QR code and waiting for it to load. With those applications, it can become an app that will be widely used by not just students currently in RMIT but also to every person coming into RMIT Sai Gon Campus.

                      <h5>- How the idea came to us: </h5><br>
                      At the beginning, after discussing and finalizing our project’s product, we end up with choosing the R-MAP app that Bui Nguyen Ngoc Tuan suggest. It is something that the whole group agreed to work on since when new students join the university, they would be entering a whole new world and RMIT is also a huge campus so we thought having a guide for them would be a good start. As we just thought of the project, we are full of dream and thought of all kinds of possibility of the product. We want the app to cover everything related to RMIT from the most common things such as delivering the most basic information about the building, the map to finally everything that has room or place has to offer. We also want to develop it so that not only it will only have information and the map for newbie but also application that can be used by every person coming into RMIT.  <br><br>
                      <h5>- How we work toward the plan for the project: </h5><br>
                      However, we are still green and the idea of making an app from scratch is nearly impossible for us so we all decided on working with tools online. That is why it is really important for us to figure out a plan on how to approach and work on the project so that we can deliver the product. That is when we decided to divided our timetable and also work between each player. In order for everyone to have a good understanding of our tool and the final outcome. Only after looking throughout all the tools that we have at our disposal and option available for us, we decided to limit our project at a certain point. What we have at our hand at the time is the tools for making app, google map, coding and mapping skills. After considered everything, we decided to limit our app to only be able to show the user about the basic information for every room and building. We can’t develop the ability to have many different types of user and the ability to change the data just yet. However, we still be able to create an app that will be helpful for the newcomer who will be joining RMIT university next semester. After that, we split our timetable and work between us so that everyone can have a deadline so that finally, we can work toward finishing the demo for the app. Firstly, we will have to research for the best available tool for making app and then all research that app. After that, we need to step by step work our way up to gathering data, adding those data to the app and finally finalizing it. On the process, we can also do the report and code the website. <br>

                      <h5>- Finding the perfect tool to create the R-Map:<br></h5>
                      We planned to create a mobile application that show the map of RMIT. Unfortunately, we had no prior knowledge about programming, so it is very difficult to create a fully functioned app by using programming languages, such as Python, JavaScript or Swift, etc. Because of that, we look for the tool that required fewer coding processes. First, we considered the MIT App Inventor, but as we did some tests, the outcome did not go as we wanted. Our intention was creating the map app that only display the RMIT Saigon South campus and all the facilities inside, and the app were going to have some features that function quite similar to the Google Map. However, when it came to the MIT App Inventor, it only allowed us to work on the provided Google Map which is not profitable for us by any mean because it doesn’t explain which building is which. It is contradicting to what we are trying to do. Due to this problem, the app developer of our team had done the research, tested many tools and finally chose Adalo as a tool to build our app. It is a free website that help us to create a mobile app without using a single coding line, thanks to that, we saved tons of time working on the application itself. Thus, it permitted the app builder to import the external sources so we could add the RMIT campus map that we had drawn on another application. <br> <br>
                      <h5> Research process: </h5><br>
                      As we had figured out what tool will be used to create the app, we started planning what contents could be shown on the app. The first step that we have to make when we considered creating the app is to determine the layout and the function. At the time, we have already known that making impossible things such as creating two different layouts and different function. Because we are having yet to fully understand the tool yet, we have some wild idea for function but only to know later that we can’t add them. Nevertheless, the road to finding what our project should has been going really smoothly but if there is any problem that we faced, it would most likely be communication. We had some problems with communicating to each other. Nevertheless, we still managed to come an agreement to proceed with working on the app. <br>
                      After that, in the first phase of developing, we were ambitious to display the 3-D map that can navigate the routes for the users, as well as some cool features such as construction scanning, a feature which uses the AR mapping technology to locate where the user is standing or an exploration achievement, a game that users can earn points or tokens when they visit a new room. However, according to the short amount of time and the limited functions of Adalo, we had made some changes to the app. Instead of demonstrating like a Google Map, which can provide the directions for the users, the app now acts like a map guide that provides the overview structure of the campus’ facilities, showing all buildings and some special rooms inside, along with the room number and a brief description about the function of the room. It might not show you on the map, but you should still be able to tell where you are by looking at the map that we created by ourselves. The next step is to get the general information of all the rooms and buildings inside the campus. This will later be used to added into our product to provide information We went around the campus, took pictures of special rooms in each building, and put them into a shared folder so that people who in charge of developing the app can use those photos to make the data more precise for the users as they can imagine how the room looks like. While we were constructing the app, we had added the “User’s idea” function to it which we had not considered as the beginning. It was a useful function since the app are still under development. User can give their feedback about the app so we can improve user’s experience or contribute any interesting ideas for the app to be more functional. After finished the project, our group felt a lot of uneasiness since it is not an exceptional that we are looking for. We discussed about how we can improve the best we can but we hit the limit of what the tools has to offer. We find every way possible, but it comes down to our ability to code in order to increase our app performance. However, for us to improve the app with our current coding ability is impossible which is why we decided to stick with the current app.  <br><br>
                      <h5> Produce our demo and report </h5><br>
                      After decided that it is most likely that we cannot improve the project application any further, we focus on finalizing our demo which is the final product. We finish getting the information for each room and getting the demo ready for use. At that time, we are currently approaching the deadline, so we also have to finalize our report and presentation. If other people were to continue working on this project instead of us, we hope that they can continue to finish what we couldn’t do in such a short time.

                    <h5>- Map: <h5>
                    <p>The map that we created will be a map of RMIT. It will be showing the layout and the name of each building. It will be more complicated than google map since it will be focusing on for people in RMIT. As we all know, the google map will only be showing the general layout of the building and some feature that standout comparing to the other such as the soccer field. However, the application that we are aiming to make is for the newcomer so the most important part which is also what the google map doesn’t have to offer is specific information. Which is why we will be drawing our own map. This way, we can edit the map so that it will be specific and having all the important information that the newcomer should know. <br>
                    <h5>- Information about rooms and building: </h5>
                    The application must have all the information and the guide for each room and building so that it can be useful for the newcomer. By clicking into a building, you will be able to see a list of rooms where you can find the room that you want to visit to see its detailed information. That way, you will not be getting lost in school or even be able to learn much more about all kinds of facilities available at schools. This application currently will not have the ability to change its content just yet. That is the reason why each room and building will only have the most basic information about that room available for the user. 
                    <br>
                    <h5>- Idea </h5>
                    We are aware that our app is not the best and there will always be rooms for improvement. That is why this app will be having a section where you can feedback about your experience and idea for improvement. For this function alone, we made 2 separated sections for it. One is for showing all the ideas that users want to give and the other is the place to add those idea. If the idea is appropriated and it is doable with the developer team’s ability, we would be more than welcoming to add those function to our app. <br>
                    <h5> User Profile: </h5>
                    This application is to keep the information of the user which can be used to identify who you are. This can later be developed further which can help the app to know who can edit which part but it is currently outside of our ability. This section will be used to save the information of the user who are using the app. This is really important for the development of the app. <br>
                    <h1 style = "text-align: center"> Out of scope: </h1>
                    <p>There are a lot more ideas that we want to build for our app that we cannot complete now due to the lack of time and knowledge: </p>
                    <h5>- The 3-D Map </h5>
                    This is what we want to create as a better version of our current version of the map. What we want to do was a 3-D Map that will be having the function to discover your current location and all the room which will be recording your journey and record all your achievement when you move to a new place <br>
                    <h5>- Navigation feature</h5>
                    This will track your movement and give you the best possible road to go to your destination. It will be helpful for the new student who are completely new who aren’t even know where the start gate is. 
                    <br>
                    <h5>- The exploration achievement, also known as the hunting gamers</h5>
                    This is to motivate the user to explore the campus and not just only focus on finish the class and going home. With this, they can explore every corner of the school which will help them understand all the right that they can have 
                    <h5>- Interact features </h5>
                    More features that users can interact with the app, for example, students can look up the daily menu of any restaurant in the food court, or students can easily check the availability of the meeting rooms and make reservation to use one of them, etc. This is needed for the app to be widely spread throughout the students. It will make the student life much easier than how it is supposed to be. <br>
                    <h1 style = "text-align: center">system scope: </h1>
                    The R-map offers to provide useful information and entertainment to the user during the app's period. There are several services that the user can access, which are as follow: <br>
                    - the map is IOS-based, which can be easily access since most of the school population is using apple devices. <br>
                    - The map will show a list of an individual building, on every building section will have information relate to what activities are happening. <br>
                    - The map will allow the user to see what is the room's purposes for, for example, lab rooms, library, mac-lab, etc. <br>
                    - User can play a game called “hunting game” while using the map as a guide. <br>
                    - The map will have an “idea and feedback” section where the user can provide ideas to the developers to improve the map and give us details about bugs. <br>
                    - Users can create their account to save their game, feedback, future development, etc. And to avoid spam.

                    - GitHub: For version control and collaboration, GitHub is a code hosting platform. It lets you and others work on projects from anywhere together. In a central repository, version control systems maintain these updates accurately, storing the changes. This makes it easier for developers to collaborate, as they can download a new software update, make improvements, and upload the latest revision. Any creator can see These new updates, downloaded, and contributed. 
                    <br>
                    -onedrive.live.com: this is where we share our work for each assignment and project. As part of its web edition of Office, Microsoft OneDrive is a file hosting service and synchronization service run by Microsoft. OneDrive allows users to store files and personal data in the cloud, share files, and sync files through Android, Windows Phone, iOS mobile devices, Windows and macOS computers. Microsoft Office documents can be submitted to OneDrive by users. <br>
                    - Adobe draw: The draw puts your favorite tools and features for vector drawing into a simple, modern interface, so it is easy to transform any concept or inspiration into a beautiful design. From inside the app, you can even launch Adobe Capture, create a new shape, and have it appeared on your Draw Canvas immediately. <br>
                    <h1 style = "text-align: center"> Programming language </h1>
                    - HTML: HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and we use language to create a webpage for our group project of making a map. Over the past few decades, the web has undergone many improvements, but HTML has always been the primary language used to create web pages. Interestingly, while websites have become more complex and engaging, HTML has also become more manageable. <br>
                    - C: to make an app, C is the main language we used in order to make a app. C is an essential procedural language. It was designed to be compiled with minimal runtime support to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that effectively map machine instructions. The language was developed to facilitate cross-platform programming, despite its low-level capabilities. A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide range of computer platforms and operating systems with few modifications to its source code.

                    <p>When creating an application, there is always a risk of making a mistake, human wide. Although there are problems that we had solve and identified, from my view, our group with five newbies will eventually face difficulties during the developing period:<br>
                    - Conflict: difference of opinion can be healthy and can cause valuable discussions if adequately handled. But in some situation, it can get out of hand, this can cause due to lack of communication or poor leader ship.<br>
                    - Personal problems: The problem can cause the project application’s development to stop; this may be because some individuals don't want or can't work on the project. There are several reasons why such as mental issues, family business, health problems, etc.<br>
                    - Lack of experience: As I mentioned before, our group is full of new students, so doing a group with little experience and knowledge is complicated and hard to succeed in this course.
                    <br>
                    <h3 style = "text-align: center"> Improving stage </h3>
                    After creating the app, into the improve and optimize our app, risk still appear but within a safe area.<br>
                    - Risk of too many users: This may seem ridiculous, but having many users is one of the big problems since we only develop a small project. Having a large number of users, which can lead to angry or confused users who leave a negative review of the App Store and delete the app.
                    <br>
                    - Security: Certainly, security breaches are nothing new and extend to every form of site or mobile app. The danger here lies in underestimating the need inside native apps for proper security precautions. Some businesses make the mistake of thinking that automatically stable native apps are and ignore appropriate security measures.

                    <p>Within the starting arrangement of the extend, the group is communicated through Facebook Courier to decide on which issue the venture will attempt to center and tailor assignments to each group part compatibly. We agreed to hold two group meetings every twice a week, consisting of an offline conference at the school yield after the tutorial class and an online discussion at the weekend via Messenger video call. We can review each other's tasks and address individuals' issues during their task success, thus enabling us to enhance the project accordingly. Other than Courier, OneDrive also assists the group store and shares project-related records and data. Due to the impacts of COVID-19 widespread, we all concur to digitalize the group discussions maximally as long because it is conceivable for each other's well-being. <br>
                    Every team member is expected to provide personal contact information and make a verbal agreement to give the qualified results for the assigned tasks at the draft deadline to ensure that the process is on the forward flow. Suppose every participant has, without a valid explanation, a delay or inability to deliver the work at the due date. In that case, a third party will review each participant's contribution to the overall project so that it can determine which situation is the best choice.

                    <h3 style= "text-align: center"> Group processes </h3>
                    As most of our team members are entirely new to the IT school, it seems to be difficult for individuals to actively and independently complete their assigned mission, as new students do not know the models of the project and their skills in analysis report writing. As a result, a senior student has to direct and guide the workflow. The team members must all agree on taking care of allocated parts of the project and commit themselves to submit their work on time for the leader to review their work at the draft deadline. Following the leader's related supporting materials, unqualified sections would have to improve. </p>
