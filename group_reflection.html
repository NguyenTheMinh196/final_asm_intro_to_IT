                      <div class = "information_block"> <p>To be honest, I do not have much experience working in a group before. Because of that, I am surprising about the cooperation skill of my teammates. Five people, five different characters, five distinct opinions, together, we could come up with a mutual agreement about our project, as well as divide the work amount fairly and complete all the things on time. Supporting each other is also an essential thing when working as a team, no one is perfect, and we cannot expect anyone to be perfect.  Every person has his or her odd strengths and weaknesses, together we learn from each other and overcome the disadvantages. Beside GitHub, we have a group chat on Messenger so every member can upload the progresses daily and other can check it to make sure no one is behind, and all the parts are met the deadlines. Everything goes smoothly as every single person in our team is aware of the importance of the group project, so we put all of us abilities to complete the project as well as we can. </p> </div>

                      <div class = "row" style=  "text-align: center"><h3> Bui Nguyen Ngoc Tuan </h3>
                      <div class = "information_block"> <p>Over the duration of the group project, I think that the majority of the time, the members cooperated smoothly with each other, especially when writing the report and doing the presentation. The downside is that we couldn’t meet our expectations from the start due to the limited time given for the project. Furthermore, some unwanted arguments burst out between members which slowed things down a little bit but were still under control. The thing that was most surprising to me was how everything turned out fine in the end. We didn’t expect to create a functional app and only relied on the GitHub website. But after doing research and found out where to build our app, everything was back on track. I actually learned a lot from my teammates, which improved my skills on using GitHub, or IT skills in general. And with the help of GitHub log of activity, the team can keep track of how much work members put into the website. </p> </div>

                      <div class = "row" style=  "text-align: center"><h3> Nguyen Phuong Nam </h3>
                      <div class = "information_block" style = "margin-bottom: 10px"> <p>Overall, our project has been managed to be done pretty good. Minh created an outstanding group’s website and Tuan made a, personally, very useful application. Despite of the fact that each member has to study and do other different work, the group’s deadline always on the line without too many arguments. I was surprised by my teammates' professional and knowledge compare to my high –school years when I used to handle group assignments with my close friends and we did it just for fun. They guided me a lot for this final report and also support me when I suffering depress in others courses. Also, I had experience about what a group project is in university. Last but not least, GitHub helped us when contribute to the website’s ideals while we can share images files and codes through our group’s repository.  </p> </div>

                      <div class = "row" style=  "text-align: center"><h3> Nguyen The Minh </h3>
                      <div class = "information_block"> <p>It is true that we might not be the best group out there or we will be the group that will be having the best result possible. Nevertheless, I saw how my group work and I can say that we did our best in this project. There are many times that many people could have done better or work better, but even so, we all worked together and all of us aim to achieve the best result possible. We could have done things sooner, we could have finished this part faster, we should have a group meeting at this point. There are definitely regret in many parts throughout our progress but what important is that we all still stay as a group until the very end. Everyone is willing to take in feedbacks and do the job that was given to them. We all covered the work that the other are missing and always ready to lend a helping hand which is something that a group should always do. I am not regret working in this group as a group for mine first project in RMIT university. </p> </div>

                      <div class = "information_block"> <p>The group members' team working capabilities have significantly strengthened after almost ten weeks of working together. My team's outcome in terms of study areas such as writing papers is beyond belief. With diligent reports and high consistency, all the community deadlines and work completed were on track. I heard a lot from the other actions and behavior towards their duties; they are disciplined and accountable for the tasks and employment, which have set a model for me to be more committed to my timetable and tighter. I have also learned a great experience about project management and how to show off my thought and emotion. And I noticed that the sense of community engagement made me increasingly feel excited about contributing something useful. There is one thing that we should boost is our knowledge, not about teamwork but in the programming path itself.  </p> </div>

                      <div class = "information_block"> <p>This whole group project was a journey for us. We were stumbled and did not know what to do at the start of the project. However, The Minh’s great leadership, Khai Minh’s hard work, Phuong Nam’s intelligence, Khanh Linh’s support and Ngoc Tuan’s motivation help the team got through many obstacles and completed the final project. The application was the most surprised to us, we did not think that we were able to create a mobile application in a short amount of time given. Arguments and conflicts happened here and there, which was something we had to stumble upon when working in a group. After all, we are all glad that we overcame the problems and the barriers holding us down along the way. As a matter of fact, the application was not created until there were two weeks left for the assignment. We also learned the soft skills, for example, how to deliver a presentation, even though we were only decent at it. More experiences were gained throughout the project, mistakes were learned and surmounted. We learned from each other a lot, actually. The Minh’s experiences with GitHub, Ngoc Tuan’s application development, Phuong Nam’s way of giving a presentation, Khai Minh’s report writing style and Khanh Linh’s enthusiasm. They would all be beneficial for us on the long run with IT major. The most important thing that we have after this project is our bond as a group. We shared many memories, including all the anger towards each other, yet that made us the dream team we need. The only thing that our group was disappointed of was that we were not able to get to work with the project sooner, thus giving us more time to, both further develop the application and enhance the report for the assignment. Last but not least, with the help of GitHub log of activity, The Minh can track members’ contribution to the work; Therefore, he can give accurate feedbacks to the team. We were heard responsibly by all members in the group as well as being helped when stuck. Overall, our team were better than we anticipated.</p> </div>
