One of his pass-time hobbies is enjoying the world of manga through reading manga novels. He finds that it is really fun reading stuff and on top of that, every single manga – light novel tells you a story that you can read whenever you want because each chapter is short, and it is very entertaining. Chosen to be the project leader, Minh has his own interest in Artificial Intelligence, and he chose to learn IT because of it. Otherwise, Minh also managed to be entranced in making video games on the road of researching programming and information technology. Before going to RMIT, he studied some online IT courses and felt that RMIT would provide more material to achieve his dream. </p>

Group schedule, at first, was a huge issue because we are currently participating in 2 different student classes. However, the remarkable advantage of Messenger has helped us to go through this problem. As the result of differences, we divided into teams. Nam and Khai Minh do some background research about our school specific buildings location, provide details about it and the report writing and material preparing team, whose jobs were to give a rhetorical base that was related to psychological impact of color on human cognitive behavior and writing reports for assignment. Khai Minh, as mentioned, also is the group’s founder. The Minh, due to his knowledge and experiences about HTML, CSS and other web development platforms, maintain the web work. Also, he is the group leader who decides when the meetings and discussion are. Tuan and Linh have confidence in writing the main program which is the application that provides all the below features. After creating the application, they will test it and upload on available download platforms. Our team knows each member's strengths and weaknesses, so we provided each of them with appropriate tasks that can make them feel enjoyable and interesting. The result was below expectation, we wanted to create a 3D map at first but because of the lack of knowledge and time rushing, it turned out to be a 2D application, but our team worked well with each other; we always gave a helping hand to each other whenever someone was in need. For the team deadlines, we have tried our best to complete it on time. </p>
